## Assignment Writeup
Note: I did the homework on the wrong forked git directory (the fall 2018) so I am submitting on here as well so it's easier to find but I submitted both parts on time just with the wrong forked directory

### Part 1 (25 pts)

This was done via the ELMS assignment.

### Part 2 (75 pts)
When there's a large and serious vulnerability it is important to remember the concept of responsible disclosure. With the knowledge of the vulnerability it is important not to step on the toes of the company, in this case the automobile company, while also making sure the product won't harm consumers. Not telling anyone would be relying on the idea that no one goes and tries to exploit the vulnerability which is not a reasonable assumption and would be an irresponsible choice. It's highly likely that the company will face legal consequences if a serious vulnerability is unearthed by consumers, especially if the car is damaged or consumer is hurt in the process. I would first tell my boss/project lead to see how the vulnerability can be tackled and how it can be done in the most efficient manner (if there's any way the 6 month time it is estimated to take could be shortened). Telling a consumer watchdog or the public can put the company in a bad spotlight and legal action could be taken against me by the company. It is possible, however,that the company does not want to postpone the ECU's release due the amount of time and human resources it will take. For the comapny to completely to completely ignore it would be highly unethical and legal consequences will be faced by them for the same reasons as if I don't share the vulnerability to anyone at all. It's important that if my boss or the project lead is pushing back on the recommendation to fix the exploit to highlight the impact it can have on consumers (car damage and consumer endangerment) and how it will very likely lead to legal consequences. For example, one of the reasons why the company might not want to address the ECU firmware vulnerabilites because making changes would take away from their profit. To counter that thinking I would mention the high amount of financial compensation they would likely have to pay in a lawsuit. Additionally black hat hackers may use the discovery of the vulnerability to "blackmail" the company for financial compensation. If they are still not able to push the release of the ECU I would strongly urge them to begin working on a patch and to officially release word of the vulnerability of the original release of the firmware when releasing the patch to allow the public to utilize the patch right away before the hacker can get to the original vulnerability. If I do nothing I will probably be responsible because even if the company as a whole gets a lawsuit the first person they will go to for answerson how the vulnerability was not known to them is me and the company will dole out their own set of consequences against me (possible legal action).
